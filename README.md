# 24 Game Solver 🧠💅

A web app that finds all possible ways to make **24** from four numbers — built with big brain energy, heartbreak, and a second CS degree.

## 💡 How It Works

- Input four numbers between 1 and 100.
- Click ✨ Solve it!
- The app returns all valid expressions that evaluate to 24.
- Covers all combinations and groupings, avoids floating-point errors, and handles edge cases better than anything else online (trust me).

## 🧪 Project History

This solver began during my intro to programming class — written out of heartbreak, boredom, and pure determination. The first version was over 4000 lines of chaotic 'for' loops. After some procrastination, healing, and real growth (both emotionally and technically), it's now refactored to ~300 clean lines.
You can find the original chaos preserved in the ['/trial-and-error'](./trial-and-error) folder.
